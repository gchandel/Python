#Python is a high level (human readable) (Layer of Low Level Language which is machine code post compilation by compiler), 
#interpreted programming language (there is no compiler so no need to compiler, interpretor will convert into byte code (low level) 
# which will further run on hardware, it will run line by line) 
# known for its dynamic typing, 
# simplicity (clean code, easy readibility)
# versatility (can be used by many places as by DE, DA, DS, Developer etc.).
